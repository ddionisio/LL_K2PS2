    "level01_intro_1": "In order to help the mighty Chin-Chin, we will need to learn how to use a bunch of objects with special properties.",
    "level01_intro_2": "By learning the properties of objects, we can use them effectively in many situations.",
    "level01_property_1": "An object has many different properties.",
    "level01_property_2": "Each property of an object tells us its quality and attribute.",
    "level01_property_3": "For example, we can say that a rubber duck is: lightweight, floats on water, and can block electricity.",
    "level01_classify_1": "Classify means to put objects into groups because of their shared properties.",
    "level01_classify_2": "This allows us to make use of objects without having to guess which is which at any situation!",
    "level01_shape_size_1": "An object can be made into different shapes and sizes.",
    "level01_shape_size_2": "For example, a soft material like clay can be squeezed to become tall, or wide.",

    "level02_intro_1": "For this part, we will be looking at the weight property of objects.",
    "level02_intro_2": "The weight of an object tells us how light or heavy it is.",
    "level02_intro_3": "One way to determine an object's weight is by using a balance scale.",
    "level02_light_1": "On this example, we can say a 2 pounds pillow is a lightweight relative to a 20 pounds block.",
    "level02_heavy_1": "A 40 pounds iron block would be a heavyweight relative to a 20 pounds block.",
    "level02_begin_1": "Now let's sort out some objects into two classifications: light and heavy!",
    "level02_begin_2": "Remember that an object is light if the left scale goes up, and heavy if the left scale goes down.",
    "buoyancy": "Buoyancy",
    "level03_intro_1": "Now we will be looking at an object's property called buoyancy.",
    "level03_buoyancy_1": "An object's buoyancy determines wether it moves upward or downward in liquid matter, such as water.",
    "level03_buoyancy_2": "If an object moves upward in water, it floats.",
    "level03_buoyancy_3": "If an object moves downward in water, it sinks.",
    "level03_begin_1": "Let's go ahead and sort these objects on wether they float or sink!",
    "level04_intro_1": "For this final part, we will be looking at the conductive property of objects.",
    "level04_intro_2": "An object's conductivity determines if it can transmit heat, electricity, or sound.",
    "level04_conductive_1": "Here we see that an iron block is highly conductive with electricity.",
    "level04_non_conductive_1": "As for a granite rock, not so much.",
    "level04_begin_1": "Now let's go ahead and sort these objects on wether they are electrically conductive or not!",
    "level04_begin_2": "If enough electricity conducts through an object, the light bulb should shine brightly.",
